<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Who doesn't like a chocolate striped cookie? These fudge stripe cookies taste just like your childhood Keebler favorites - but <br>
    improved with real chocolate and an all-butter cookie. It is made with a simple sugar cookie dough that is very easy to work with and <br>    
    roll out. I used semisweet chocolate to echo the sweeter taste of the Keebler originals, but you can of course use any chocolate you like.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Combine butter and sugar in a stand mixer and beat with the paddle attachment <br>
        on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, stopping to scrape <br>
        down sides of the mixing bowl once or twice. Add egg, vanilla, and salt; beat <br>
        until well-incorporated, about 30 seconds. Reduce mixer speed to low and <br>
        gradually add flour, beating on low  until just combined, about 1 minute.
    </li>
    <li>
        Divide dough in half, and flatten each half into a 1/2-inch-thick disk. (Disk will <br>
        be about 12.5 oz.) Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and chill until form, at <br>
        least 30 minutes or up to 2 days.
    </li>
    <li>
        Line two baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Working with one disk at a time, roll dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/4- <br>
        inch thickness. if desired, prick the dough with a docking tool or run over the <br>
        dough with an embossed rolling pin to create a decorative texture. if you do not <br>
        have a docking or decorating tool, use a meat mallet to emboss the dough: <br>
        apply the mallet texture-side down and lightly tap the center of the smooth <br>
        side with the heel of your hand,and repeat, being sure to line up decorative <br>
        scores.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cut out rounds with a 2-inch round cutter. Place rounds 1-inch apart on the <br>
        prepared baking sheets.Repeat with second dough disk, then gather all dough <br>
        scraps and discard. Using a 1/2-inch cutter or piping tip, cut out and remove the <br>
        center of each dough round to create a donut shape. Discard extra dough. Chill <br>
        cut-out cookies until firm, about 30 minutes
    </li>
    <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    </li>
    <li>
        Bake cookies, one sheet at a time, in the preheated oven until edges begin to <br>
        brown, about 12 minutes. cool cookies on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. <br>
        Transfer cookies to a wire rack, and cool completely, about 30 minutes. Repeat <br>
        with second baking sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place chocolate in a medium microwave-safe-bowl. Microwave on HIGH until <br>
        melted, about 2 minutes, stopping to stir every 30 seconds. Transfer 1/4 cup of <br>
        the chocolate to a piping pag and cut a 1/8-inch hole at the end.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place wire rack over a parchment lined baking sheet. Pipe four stripes across the <br>
        top of each cookie. Dip the base of each cookie int the bowl of melted <br>
        chocolate, scraping the excess off on the side of the bowl. Place chocolate-side <br>
        down on a clean parchment-lined baking sheet. Chill until chocolate is set, <br>
        about 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Store cookies in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
